Location listed by a unique number "location ID"

Party is split into 2 groups.

Input: 2 list of numbers.

Task: "measure how far apart they are."

Pair up the smallest number in the left list with smallest number in the right list.
then the second, and so on.

How far apart they are is the difference of the above pairs summed up.

edge cases: 
list of different lengths. 
in this case end summation no more distance added.


Solution Ideas:
Do both lists need to be sorted first?
I believe so. going to use py sorted for this but will use this as practice for other languages.

Once both sort iterate through both.

As we have to iterate though both list to read. we are instead going to insert into list respecting order using binary search.
